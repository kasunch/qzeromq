# QZeroMQ - A C++ Qt library for ØMQ

QZeroMQ is a [Qt](https://www.qt.io/) library written in C++ for [ØMQ](https://zeromq.org/), a widely used asynchronous messaging library. 
QZeroMQ provides an elegant socket API and seamlessly integrates with Qt's native event loop.

# Why QZeroMQ?

In short, QZeroMQ solves the problem of integrating ØMQ's sockets into Qt's native event loop.
Solving this problem particularly challenging since ØMQ's sockets gives only edge triggered notifications instead of level triggered notifications. 

The is nicely explained in the articles [ZeroMQ - Edge Triggered Notification](https://funcptr.net/2012/09/10/zeromq---edge-triggered-notification/) and [Embedding ZeroMQ In The Libev Event Loop](https://funcptr.net/2013/04/20/embedding-zeromq-in-the-libev-event-loop/). 
QZeroMQ follows the suggestions from these articles such that ``aboutToBlock()`` and ``awake()`` signals of [QAbstractEventDispatcher](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qabstracteventdispatcher.html) are used to check readiness for reading/writing from/to the socket.

# How to use the API?

The socket API of QZeroMQ can be used as follows.

```c
    // Global header file
    #include <qzmq.hpp>

    // Connecting to an end-point
    QZmqSocket *client = QZmqSocket::create((ZMQ_PAIR);
    client->connect("inproc://test");

    // Binding to an end-point
    QZmqSocket *server = QZmqSocket::create(ZMQ_PAIR);
    server->bind("inproc://test");

    // Connecting signals
    connect(client, &QZmqSocket::onMessage, this, &MyClass::onClientMessage);
    connect(server, &QZmqSocket::onMessage, this, &MyClass::onServerMessage);

    // Sending messages
    QZmqMessage *msg = QZmqMessage::create();
    client->send(msg);

    // Closing sockets
    delete client;
    delete server;
```

# Limitations & developer notes

Like ØMQ sockets, ``QZmqSockets`` are **NOT thread safe**.
Moreover, ``QZmqSockets`` cannot be moved between threads since each ``QZmqSocket`` is associated with the event loop of the thread in which the socket is created.
Another words, create/destroy ``QZmqSockets`` in the thread that use them. 

# How to build
QZeroMQ's build system is based on [Cmake](https://cmake.org/).

## On Linux
You can build QZeroMQ as follows with make.

```bash
# Create a directory for build artifacts
mkdir build
cd build
# Use Cmake to generate build tool (make) files
cmake .. -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="<QT installation directory>;<ZeroMQ installation directory>" -DWITH_PERF_TOOL=ON
# Build using make
make

```
